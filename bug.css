The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the usage of `calc()` function and percentage values:

```css
.container {
  width: calc(50% - 10px);
}
```

This code intends to make the container's width 50% of its parent's width, minus 10 pixels. However, if the parent element doesn't have a defined width, the calculation might fail to produce the expected result. The `50%` within `calc()` is relative to the parent's width, which is undefined; thus the whole expression is indeterminate. 

Another potential issue is the order of operations within a `calc()` expression.  If the expression is complex, it's crucial to ensure the operations are performed in the correct sequence.  Parentheses can help clarify this. This is less of a bug and more of a potential pitfall.
